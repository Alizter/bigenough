synopsis: >-
  A small library to do epsilon - N reasoning

description: |-
  The package contains a package to reasoning with big enough objects
  (mostly natural numbers). This package is essentially for backward
  compatibility purposes as `bigenough` will be subsumed by the near
  tactics. The formalization is based on the Mathematical Components
  library.

  # A small library to do epsilon - N reasoning.

  This repository is essentially for archiving purposes as `bigenough`
  will be subsumed by the [near tactics](https://github.com/math-comp/analysis/blob/9bfd5a1971c6989f51d9c44341bb71b2fd5e3c76/topology.v#L93).

  The formalization is based on the [Mathematical Components](https://github.com/math-comp/math-comp) library for the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) proof assistant,
  although it requires only the ssreflect package.
